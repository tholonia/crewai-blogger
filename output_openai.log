The term epigenome is derived from the Greek word epi which literally means "above" the genome. The epigenome consists of chemical compounds that modify, or mark, the genome in a way that tells it what to do, where to do it, and when to do it. Different cells have different epigenetic marks. These epigenetic marks, which are not part of the DNA itself, can be passed on from cell to cell as cells divide, and from one generation to the next.

Narration

The epigenome is the collection of all of the epigenetic marks on the DNA in a single cell. The epigenomic marks different between different cell types. So, a blood cell will have different marks or modifications than a liver cell. The epigenomic modifications, the whole collection of all of the epigenetic marks on my blood cell DNA should be more similar to all of the marks on your blood cell DNA than to the collection of all the marks on my liver cell DNA. So this is a way of defining a particular type of cell. Now due to individual differences my epigenome will differ from your epigenome even in the same tissue. It's those differences that make us all individuals, and we'll see even greater changes in a state of disease. So a comparison of a normal cell and all of its epigenetic marks, or the epigenome of that cell, will differ from the diseased state of that same cell type. And we can use these differences to figure out mechanisms of disease.

Text: It’s been 20 years since the completion of the Human Genome Project, one of the most ambitious and fruitful scientific endeavours in all of human history. The mapping of the human genome in 2003 engendered a new approach to biomedical research, laying out the complex musical score of our DNA that would allow us to discover, analyze, and even change the individual notes that make up the symphony of the human body.
If the genome is the score, then epigenetics is the orchestra – the combination of biological players in the body that determine how those notes are expressed. Just as an individual musician might play a measure more legato than is written on the sheet, an individual environmental factor might cause a gene to express itself differently in the human body, without any change to the underlying DNA. As an orchestra can play a score in a variety of different ways, epigenetic modifications – both natural and human-engineered – can alter the expression of genes in response to environmental cues, causing lasting effects on an individual’s health and well-being over the course of their life.
“There is an innate part of shaping the epigenome that happens from conception onwards in all of us,” says Dr. Michael Kobor, UBC professor of medical genetics. “There's pretty good evidence that there are certain sensitive periods during human development where given environments or experiences might exert a more profound effect on the epigenome. The best-studied sensitive periods are during early life, where a lot of the research has shown that if something happens to a growing child, it can get under the skin, as we like to say, and in part, be associated with different changes in the epigenome.”
THE PLASTICITY OF NEWBORN BRAINS 
Kobor and his team have been working with Dr. Steven Miller – a neurologist who focuses on newborns, studying brain injury and brain development in babies who are critically ill, or born prematurely, or with congenital disease. They are seeking to understand the factors involved in gene expression during the early stages of life, particularly the epigenetics of brain development and how this affects brain health across the human lifespan.

The idea that we can rewind epigenetic changes and create positive epigenetic patterns speaks to the potential to not only slow down, but even reverse some of the negative effects of one’s environment, and possibly even aging itself.

“We've turned to epigenetics to understand potential ways in which a baby's everyday experience might influence the trajectory of their brain development,” says Miller, who heads the Department of Pediatrics at UBC. “The newborn brain is plastic, and there has been lots of outstanding work in neuroplasticity that shows how the immature or developing brain responds to changes in their environment.”
The notion of guiding plasticity in a newborn brain is an even more recent development than human genome mapping. The newborn brain has specific vulnerabilities to injury from things like perinatal asphyxia – a lack of blood flow or oxygen at birth. Where once it was believed such injuries had fixed outcomes, research has shown that these injuries can be prevented or even reversed by changing environmental factors.
For instance, full-term babies with perinatal asphyxia can now be treated in a newborn intensive care unit, where they are cooled to 33.5 degrees for 72 hours. This process, known as therapeutic hypothermia, slows down the metabolism, decreases excitatory neurotransmission, and has other positive effects that aren’t completely understood, ultimately decreasing mortality and reducing significant neurodevelopmental disability.
“If you had told me at the start of my career that there would be a treatment for perinatal asphyxia,” says Miller, “I would have thought that that was just science fiction.”
GENES EXPRESSING THEMSELVES
The current frontier of epigenetic studies is how gene expression influences the transformation of the brain across childhood, and the trajectory of childhood brain maturation that sets up brain health for the life course. At the centre of this work is an understanding of DNA methylation – how the addition of a methyl chemical group to a DNA molecule affects gene expression – which can have significant impacts on the body's overall functioning and health.

Text: In a new paper, Sinclair and his co-authors outline a theory arguing that epigenetic changes are the underlying cause of aging [1]. When cells get old It is not every day that one of the most prominent geroscientists presents a new theory of aging. David Sinclair of Harvard, along with two co-authors, Yuancheng Ryan Lu and Xiao Tian, have just published “The Information Theory of Aging” in Nature Aging. This theory was proposed by Sinclair years ago [2], and this new paper is an attempt to summarize it based on the most recent research. The ability to store and retrieve information is central to life, which relies on the constant reproduction of complex organisms using DNA blueprints. However, on top of that digital genetic code, there is a much messier realm of epigenetics, which regulates how genetic information is translated into proteins. There is a vast variety of cells in an organism, all of which have similar genomes. If a cell wants to be, say, a neuron and not a fibroblast, something must tell that cell which genes should be active and to what extent. This something is epigenetic information, and it is stored in a mixed digital-analog format. Epigenetic regulation is performed by numerous mechanisms, such as DNA methylation and acetylation and interfering RNA, and it can be altered by factors like environmental signals and cellular damage. The information theory of aging postulates that the loss of this regulatory information is the underlying cause of aging that ultimately drives its other manifestations. Simply put, cells accumulate epigenetic noise, gradually becoming worse at what they do. What should have remained inactive starts getting translated and vice versa. This causes cells to become confused, experiencing their own version of Alzheimer’s. Some epigenetic changes are so closely associated with aging that it gave rise to epigenetic clocks, which are among the most reliable aging biomarkers [3]. Reversing the clock However, epigenetic dysregulation is reversible. The foremost example is what happens very early in an organism’s development. This levels the epigenetic landscape so that a new organism can start from scratch [4]. Unfortunately, we still don’t know how exactly that happens. DNA mutations have also been proposed as a fundamental cause of aging [5], but Sinclair and his co-authors argue against that. They point out that, unlike epigenetic alterations, DNA mutations cannot be erased: we all carry the mutations accumulated by our ancestors, which is how evolution works. There is other data that points to somatic mutations not being the main driver of aging. For instance, in many experiments, animals cloned from an aged somatic cell with all its accumulated mutations had normal healthy lifespans [6]. A few years ago, scientists learned to mimic this “embryonic reset” to some extent with cellular reprogramming. Using certain genes that control other genes (transcription factors), or even small molecules, we can now erase the identity of aged cells, turning them into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). This is accompanied by a deep epigenetic rejuvenation. Later, partial cellular reprogramming was developed [7], in which carefully measured induction of the same factors leads to epigenetic rejuvenation without erasing cellular identity. Both techniques have demonstrated a huge potential in geroscience, extending healthspan and lifespan in various animal models. For instance, we recently covered a paper in which Sinclair’s group showed glaucoma reversal in mice by reprogramming retinal ganglion cells. The trade-off Unfortunately, most living things have evolved in ways that accept the loss of epigenetic information. As scientists have discovered, some proteins of the sirtuin family play a double role, guarding both the genome and the epigenome [8]. When all is calm, those proteins sit still, repressing the transcription of genes that must remain silent in this particular cell type. However, when a double DNA break occurs nearby, they rush to the scene, facilitating the re

Do Children Inherit Parents’ Stressful Experiences?

Tufts School of Medicine researcher Larry Feig is enrolling participants in a study with Boston IVF to see if the effects of men’s positive or negative experiences can be passed across generations because of altered sperm

Most of us learned in high school that people get half their genes from their father and half from their mother. That’s true, but it turns out the way parents contribute to their offspring’s genetics is more complicated—and more intriguing.

Scientists are discovering that a parent’s experiences can lead to changes in gene expression that are encoded in the sperm or egg and passed to offspring. In other words, there is a way in which offspring inherit the experiences of their parents. This is different than inheriting genes for brown or blue eyes. It’s more like inheriting genes that are switched on or off for the purpose of being better adapted to a particular environment.

Larry Feig , professor of developmental, molecular, and chemical biology at Tufts University School of Medicine , is helping to illuminate how changes in gene expression, called epigenetic changes, can be passed down.

Feig says the idea is often startling to people: “You inherit the experiences of your ancestors? How could this be? And why?”

The “why” could be that genetic expression based on parental experience helps set the stage for successful offspring. For example, mice raised in cold environments pack on a type of fat called brown fat to keep themselves warm. Their offspring are born with extra brown fat, presumably giving them a survival boost in cold temperatures.

“The idea is that under normal circumstances, it’s a good thing,” Feig says. “Like any other regulatory system, if it’s in excess, it could cause harm.” Regarding the latter, Feig is interested in whether childhood trauma might result in parents passing along epigenetic changes that make their children more susceptible to psychiatric disorders.

Feig has shown that male mice exposed to social stress (in the form of frequent rearranging of social groups) have different levels of molecules called microRNA in their sperm. After the sperm has fertilized the egg, these microRNA molecules give directions about how genes are expressed in the developing embryo. In the sperm of the stressed mice and early embryos derived from them, Feig found that two specific microRNA molecules occur at much lower levels than those from non-stressed mice.

The female offspring of these stressed mice show more anxious behavior than normal. The male offspring don’t; however, they do have the same changes in their sperm, even though they weren’t stressed themselves. And their female offspring are anxious.

Feig followed up with a small pilot study in humans and found that men with adverse childhood experiences (such as physical or emotional abuse or neglect) had decreased levels of the same microRNA in their sperm. “We saw changes in men’s sperm that matched the changes in mice sperm,” he says. “It was a striking result.”

Now Feig is working on a much larger study in humans to confirm those findings and to delve deeper.

In the new study, participating men will be asked not only about adverse childhood experiences, but also about adult adverse experiences such as those associated with PTSD, as well as their current levels of depression and anxiety. In addition, they will be asked about the sorts of positive childhood experiences that have been shown to mitigate early trauma. Feig wonders whether those positive experiences might boost the levels of the two microRNA molecules in sperm. This seems to be the case for mice, according to studies by other researchers.

In addition, the new study brings in another generation—the men’s fathers. This will help illuminate the question of whether stress or trauma in one generation shows up in stress-related sperm changes in the next generation.

In the past, Feig has mostly worked with mice and cells, not humans. While making the transition, he benefited from his daughter’s experience. Emily Feig, A08, is a clinical psychologist and researcher at Massachusetts General Hospital and assistant professor at Harvard Medical School, who was introduced to research in the Tufts Summer Scholars program . She now studies novel ways to improve health behaviors in people with obesity. Both father and daughter have enjoyed the role reversal.

“Over the years, I’ve turned to him for advice many times,” she says. “Now, he was describing what he was doing and I could say, ‘Oh, have you thought about this?’” She provided informal advice about things like how to explain the study in nontechnical language to participants during the enrollment and consent process.

Feig plans to enroll about 300 participants, and to do so, he is collaborating with Boston IVF, a clinical fertility center that also includes a fertility research program headed by Scientific Director Denny Sakkas. Tufts student Aidan Chen, A24, is helping with enrollment and consent at Boston IVF, where he was interning when Feig began his study. Chen, who is double majoring in biology and music, plans to become a physician and he’s especially interested in fertility. “So many people have problems with fertility,” he says. “The ability to bring joy to somebody’s life was what attracted me to this field.”

For Feig’s study, Chen reaches out to men who come to the center about fertility issues, explaining the study and inviting them to participate. “I’ve learned a lot about how to communicate efficiently and empathetically with patients who are coming in,” he says. “It’s really important to be considerate because these patients are coming for care first and foremost. The research doesn’t impede that process in any way.”

Chen has also started working in Feig’s lab under the tutelage of postdoc Alexandre Champroux who is heading this project. Chen is learning biochemical techniques to analyze epigenetic events, as well as engaging in conversations about study design and data analysis.

“It’s been a really enlightening experience to be able to interact with all the parts of the project from beginning to end,” Chen says. “I get to consent patients, see them in person, bring the samples to Dr. Feig’s lab and learn about what we’re doing there.”

The samples include not only sperm, but saliva as well. Feig and members of his lab are analyzing the saliva to see if it shows the same fluctuations in microRNA as sperm. If so, perhaps in the future, a simple saliva test could identify people whose microRNA levels indicate that their stressful experiences put them — or their future offspring — at risk for mental illness.

“If certain microRNA changes make the next generation susceptible to psychiatric disorders,” he says, “you might be able to reverse those changes, by therapy, meditation or antidepressants, before people have kids. It’s much easier to change epigenetics than genetics, because epigenetic regulation of genes, including those that control sperm microRNA levels, responds to the environment.”

Text: The concept of epigenetic inheritance is fairly recent, having emerged in the late twentieth century. Yet, epigenetic inheritance is gaining more and more attention and interest in the scientific community. Research on epigenetic inheritance continues to be published in the world’s foremost scientific journals, such as a study recently published in the journal Nature Communications. What is epigenetic inheritance, and what makes it so interesting to the scientific community?
A closer look at the history of the concepts of inheritance and evolution can inform the answers to these questions.
Ideas on evolution date from the writings of philosopher Anaximander of Miletus (c. 610-546 B.C.E.). He thought, since infants and young children require protection during early development, humans were therefore more evolutionarily recent organisms and had descended from fish and other marine life forms, whose young did not need protection.
It wasn’t until the eighteenth century that a more objective and scientifically testable hypothesis was proposed by several naturalists—that life evolves as the environment changes.
French biologist Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck (1744-1829) first proposed how life evolves. Lamarck posed three salient principles: that the more a part of the body is used, the larger and stronger it becomes and the less likely it is to deteriorate; these changes and characteristics acquired by an organism during its lifetime could be passed to offspring; and what is also known as the orthogenesis hypothesis—that organisms have an innate drive to become more complex. Lamarckism is now most famously known as an “incorrect” theory of evolution. Body parts of an organism certainly may change based on use and disuse, but bodily changes that an organism acquires (through use or disuse) during its lifetime cannot be inherited by offspring. The children of bodybuilders are not born with toned muscles. Additionally, we know that evolution is not necessarily directed towards complexity (this is among other reasons for why the orthogenesis hypothesis is now considered obsolete); the Texas blind salamander species evolved as its ancestors lost their eyes through generations of evolution.
In the mid-nineteenth century, naturalists Charles Darwin (1809-1882) and Alfred Russel Wallace (1823-1913) independently developed the theory of evolution by natural selection—the process by which evolution occurs as organisms having more survival and reproductive success pass down their heritable traits to offspring. Influenced by Lamarck’s work, Darwin also, incorrectly, believed in the heritability of acquired characteristics but rejected the orthogenesis hypothesis. As Wallace himself acknowledged, Darwin’s extensive development of the theory of natural selection still is one of the greatest contributions to biology, earning Darwin the title as the “father of evolution.” Building upon Darwin’s work, Gregor Mendel (1822-1884) conducted experiments with garden peas and flowers to study inheritance. Mendel discovered that organisms pass down discrete heritable units—what we now know as “genes“—to offspring.
The importance of this pioneering work cannot be overstated. Though the work of specifically Darwin and Wallace has most profoundly influenced our understanding of evolution, Lamarck’s impact is also lasting. For example, our current understanding of long-term memory—of how our brain encodes memories at the molecular and cellular levels—has connections to Lamarck’s hypothesis on how use and disuse result in changes at the level of individual organisms.
An interesting question then arises: Could memories be encoded at the genetic level? If so, could these memories, in the form of genetic information, be passed down to future generations?
An experience could be “genetically remembered” in the form of genetic information if it induces changes in either the genome (an organism’s entire set of DNA, the molecule that makes up genes and carries genetic information) or the epigenome (the set of chemical modifications and markers to the genome). There is evidence that, not only the genome, but also specific markers of the epigenome are heritable, provided that the epigenetic markers pass two epigenome reprogramming checkpoints. If encoded and “remembered” through the genome or epigenome, the genetic memory of an experience could potentially be inherited by future generations.
The inheritance of genetic memories could follow three patterns. In parental/intergenerational inheritance, an event experienced through a parent is encoded as a genetic memory in offspring—for example, prenatal maternal stress might be encoded as a genetic memory by offspring who may also experience the stress in utero. In multigenerational inheritance, the genetic memory is passed no further than to the immediate offspring of the individual who experienced and encoded the memory—following the previous example, the genetic memory could be passed down no further than the offspring of the individuals who experienced and encoded stress in utero (i.e., this offspring would also be the grandchildren of the prenatally stressed mother). In transgenerational inheritance, the genetic memory is passed down through individuals who have not directly experienced the memory—through the grandchildren of the prenatally stressed mother, to the great-grandchildren.
Of course, genes and DNA can be inherited parentally/intergenerationally, multigenerationally, or transgenerationally. Additionally, it has been known that some species of plants, yeasts, and roundworms show inheritance of the epigenome. But evidence for epigenetic inheritance in mammals has not emerged until within the twenty-first century. For example, in 2014, a study found intergenerational epigenetic influences in the metabolism of adult mice who were undernourished in utero via their mothers. Other studies have shown transgenerational epigenetic inheritance in mice and rats.
Researchers have shown multigenerational epigenetic inheritance in humans, studying the multigenerational inheritance of effects of psychosocial stress and lead exposure during pregnancy. To date, there is no evidence for transgenerational epigenetic inheritance in humans.
In retrospect, it can be ascertained that the Lamarckian hypothesis on the inheritance of acquired characteristics is indeed true to an extent: an experience could be encoded by an organism as a genetic memory, either in the genome or epigenome; and then potentially inherited by future generations. The genetic memory might be a remnant of the experience that changed the genome or epigenome; or, the memory could be an adaptive response to the experience at the level of the genome or epigenome. We might carry (and in turn pass down to future generations) more heritable information than we think—indeed, information also newly acquired and genetically encoded during an ancestor’s lifetime.
Research on epigenetic inheritance is not without ethical implications. For instance, scientists think that editing the epigenome might be more efficient than editing the genome; the ethics of epigenetic editing deserves careful evaluation and thoughtful discussion, considering that we know the epigenome is indeed heritable to an extent.
Inheritance is a new and exciting frontier in epigenetics research. Further research on epigenetic inheritance could inform our understanding of the relationship between inheritance and evolution, helping us understand the full extent of our inheritance to future generations.

Text: We pass down our eye color and baldness to our kids. It seems we also pass along health problems from bad food we consume and smoke we inhale.

Two hands hold a fast food burger against the backgrop of DNA strands. Illustration by News Decoder
 This article was produced exclusively for News Decoder’s global news service. It is through articles like this that News Decoder strives to provide context to complex global events and issues and teach global awareness through the lens of journalism. Learn how you can incorporate our resources and services into your classroom or educational program. Is our children’s health predestined before they take their first breath?
It turns out the answer is yes: We don’t just pass on our DNA to our children, but also the molecules that are influenced by our experiences — the good, the bad and the ugly.
The genes we inherit from our parents, our DNA, serve as the blueprint for our development. We pass them on to our children, then they to theirs and so forth.
Modern lifestyles have resulted in new experiences and new exposures, such as processed high-fat and high-sugar foods, a stressful environment, less exercise and more exposure to air pollution. These shifts not only affect well-being but have repercussions for the next generation and those that follow.
Teams of scientists worldwide are digging into the effects of our lifestyle habits on the health of our children and the generations to come.
A collaboration between researchers at the University of Southampton in Great Britain and at the University of Bergen in Norway found, for example, a link between fathers who smoke and a higher risk for their children of asthma, low lung function and obesity.
They are what we eat.
The link is something scientists have termed epigenetics: the study of how our behavior and environment can affect how cells in our bodies work.
It has long been established that our experiences can cause changes that affect the way our genes work; our behaviours and environment can leave distinctive signatures on our genes through the phenomenon of epigenetics.
Now, recent studies demonstrate that these experiences may be directly transmitted to offspring.
We understand how a woman’s health throughout pregnancy, childbirth and the postnatal period can affect a baby. A pregnant woman’s actions and environment have a significant influence on the developing embryo and fetus. Later, her choices while breastfeeding can affect what is transmitted to the baby through breast milk.
Until now, the father seemed a bit irrelevant. But emerging data now seems to imply that his lifestyle is important too. It influences offspring in other ways, potentially making them more susceptible to a range of disorders, particularly those affecting the brain.
The saying “like father, like son” now seems to have real biological substance. It turns out health habits shape the destiny of generations to come.
Bad habits imprinted in our molecules
Environmental exposures can alter the epigenome, the collection of molecules found in and around the DNA in human cells, resulting in unique signatures specific to each exposure that persist throughout life.
“The memory of the exposure is being passed through generations,” said John Holloway, a researcher at the University of Southampton who specializes in the genetic and epigenetic regulation of allergy and airways disease.
For instance, smoking can produce three distinct patterns of change in someone’s DNA: one from maternal smoking, another from personal smoking and a third from the father’s smoking before conception. So a person’s risk of developing a disorder is influenced by a combination of inherited genes, personal habits, maternal exposures and the father’s preconception habits.
“It all adds up,” Holloway said.
Historically, the spotlight has been on Darwin’s theory of evolution — that random genetic changes in organisms occur randomly and accumulate over time. This supports the concept of natural selection as some of the genetic changes might make a species more suited to surviving changes in the environment or cataclysmic events.
Our food selections and natural selection
Natural selection can alter a species in small ways, causing changes over several generations, for example the development of shorter fingers and longer opposable thumbs to allow humans to firmly grasp and manipulate objects. It is also capable of creating entirely new species and is responsible for the transformation of dinosaurs into birds and the common ancestor of apes and humans into today’s people, chimpanzees and gorillas.
The theory underscores a gradual process that unfolds over hundreds of years. But it doesn’t explain the immediate effects of the habits that rapidly influence offspring.
Like Darwin, the French biologist Jean-Baptiste Lamarck believed that organisms adapt to their environments and pass on these adaptations.
Lamarck proposed that organisms achieve this by changing their behaviour and, consequently, their bodies — like an athlete working out and getting buff — and that these changes are passed through to offspring.
For instance, Lamarck thought that giraffes originally had shorter necks, but their ancestors stretched their necks to reach tasty leaves just out of reach. This stretching of the neck was inherited by successive generations, he proposed, ultimately resulting in the long necks that giraffes now have.
Lamarck believed that within just one generation, parents can send information to their offspring to increase an adaptation. But is this adaptation always a good thing?
A bad diet can alter sperm.
In a study conducted at The Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health in Melbourne, Australia, scientists fed mice a modern Western junk-food diet of high-fat high-sugar food. The result? Changes in the males’ sperm that not only altered brain development but also gut development and their offsprings’ microbiomes, the collection of all of the microbes in their bodies.
Anthony Hannan, a brain researcher at The Florey who investigates gene-environment interactions in brain disorders, said that these changes in the mice may also happen in humans. The study suggests that sperm could carry information about the father’s diet, potentially influencing the development of his offspring, he said.
Notably, the cells responsible for forming sperm throughout a man’s life develop during puberty. So what a teen eats and does during this critical period can have a lasting effect on sperm development and the genetic information passed down to subsequent generations.
According to other data, exposures can potentially be passed on to great-grandchildren. Hannan says these factors may contribute to higher occurrences of depression, anxiety disorders and other cognitive issues. The brain appears to be the primary organ affected by this transgenerational epigenetic inheritance, affecting its development, structure and function.
Understanding these connections is crucial for shaping new public health policies and finding ways to prevent diseases down the line, making sure we’re looking out for the health of future generations.
Holloway has this message to teenagers: “The things that you’re exposed to don’t just have a consequence for yourself but could have consequences for your future children.”

Text: Hippiesq’s Newsletter As I was writing this essay, I thought it was way too obvious, and that I would not end up publishing it. After all, who doesn’t realize that a healthy body is important in life? This notion is the furthest thing from a novel or controversial concept that I could think of. Yet I am still compelled to publish it, because I am concerned that the most obvious and undisputed ideas are the ones that are being thrown under the bus in the age of faux kindness and pretend activism. Here goes. Nowadays, it seems that a healthy body is not a priority. There seem to be many over-riding goals that supersede the preservation of our health. For instance, if somebody is stressed or emotionally upset, it’s of supreme importance to sooth the emotional pain, even if that requires treatments that may cause serious effects and side effects, detrimental to physical health. The most concerning of these “treatments” for emotional distress is related to sex - male or female. It is becoming more and more common, acceptable, and even laudable in today’s society, if someone is uncomfortable with their sex (we call this “gender dysphoria”), to immediately, or as soon as practicable, provide medical interventions to remove the offending sex characteristics, such as breasts, periods, and female voice patterns in biological females, or testicles and penises, flat chests, and body hair in biological males. This applies not just to adults, but also to pubescent teens, starting at Tanner Stage II of puberty (an early stage of puberty, reached by girls around age 11 and by boys around age 12). A large majority of these young people are either on the Autism spectrum, suffer anxiety or other mental health issues, or are homosexual and/or gender non-conforming, making them more vulnerable than the average teen (who is somewhat vulnerable based on age). For younger children, we do not - because we cannot - engage in any medical interventions. However, we engage in extreme social interventions by assuring children - starting around age 3 or 4, who express dissatisfaction with their biological sex, or who declare that they are actually the opposite sex - that they are “really” the opposite sex. We also make everyone around them agree to keep up the pretense. These children are guided by the adults in their lives to believe that they should never grow up to be the sex they are. Instead, as they approach puberty, perhaps around age 9 or 10, we explain to them that they will soon have medical interventions to assure that they will never appear as the sex they are, but can appear as if they are the opposite sex, the sex we all pretend they are. Thus, while we do not medically intervene in children before Tanner Stage II, we set the scene for the inevitability of those later medical interventions with our words and our actions. The question I pose is whether a healthy body deserves to be prioritized. Personally, I believe it does. After all, we only have one body for our entire life, and, when it has health problems, they can prevent us from accomplishing everything else in life worth striving for. For example, when treatments for discomfort with biological sex render individuals sterile, as these treatments often (but not always) do, they make it impossible to have biological children. While not everyone wants to have biological children, a large majority of people do want this at some point in their lives, and most individuals who have and raise children find the experience to be one of the most rewarding parts, if not the defining experience, of their lives. Granted, adoption is a wonderful and valuable experience as well, but that does not mean the ability to have biological children is not important or should be sacrificed simply because someone is having difficulty accepting one’s biological sex. Further, the time-consuming and energy-consuming nature of medical transition itself prioritizes the elimination of emotional distress over a healthy functioning life. This is particularly true when transition is acco

 Parent Tips

We all want to raise happy, healthy kids. But the environment in which we’re attempting to do it often leaves us swimming upstream. We all know what it feels like to wonder whether we belong, and to see bodies that look very different than ours deemed “perfect.” Our generation grew up seeing “ideal” bodies on magazine covers at the checkout aisle or in an evening sitcom, but our kids are bombarded day and night. So how can we possibly counteract the pressure? Cultivating a positive body image starts with us. It’s more than simply being careful about the way we talk about weight and bodies in front of our kids (although that’s crucial), it’s practicing and internalizing the work ourselves. Our own journey toward body positivity or neutrality may still be a work in progress, but we can work to make sure our children get an early start on loving who they are. Here are a few ways: 1. Celebrate All Kinds of Attributes 
You are more than the size of your body. You may be kind or funny, talented, strong, or trustworthy. The same is true for your child. When you’re praising the things they do well, make sure it’s not about size and shape. Focus on their problem-solving abilities, athleticism, great smile, or that sweet thing you overheard them say to a friend. 2. Reframe Your View of Physical Activity 
Exercise should never be seen as a punishment for something you ate, or merely a tool for changing your body. If you can begin to see exercise and movement as a healthy outlet for stress, a mood booster, a means of socially connecting with others, or even an artistic expression, it will quickly become something fun and even meaningful. There are a million ways to move your body, it just takes a little curiosity and effort to find the ones you love. Explore activities with your child to discover what you both enjoy and maybe even be active together. 3. See Food with Fresh Eyes 
Most of us were taught to clean our plates, and developed strong categories for which foods were “good” and which ones were “bad.” Our parents did this because they believed it was right, but unfortunately these labels just put undue attention and pressure on food and created anxiety around eating. Instead of giving our kids binary labels on food, we should talk to them about how our bodies need healthy nutrients, colors, and variety to grow strong. 4. Be the Change You Wish to See 
If you grew up in a home where someone spoke critically about their body or yours, your journey may be complicated. You may still deal with insecurity or disordered eating, but that doesn’t mean you can’t still be a good example for your child. Choose to do things differently in your home. Unfollow influencers who make you feel bad about yourself. Take steps to implement numbers 1-3 in your home and ask for help if you need it. Let’s help our kids see that their worth runs far more than skin deep.

Text: How to Have a Realistic Conversation About Beauty With Your Kids Study after study confirms that prettiness can be a privilege. But I want my daughters to resist the tyranny of vanity. Photo-illustration by Joanne Imperio / The Atlantic. Sources: Ellen Graham / Getty; Harrington Collection / Getty. Talking to my three elementary-school-age daughters about beauty can be hard. No matter how much I insist that their looks don’t matter, that their character is what truly counts in life, they don’t believe me. About a year ago, I was tiptoeing down the hallway after tucking my 9- and 6-year-olds into their bunk bed when I overheard the younger one. “Momma says it doesn’t matter if you’re beautiful; it matters if you’re clever,” she said to her sister. The eldest replied, “She only says that because she’s already pretty.” As I recount in my book, Flawless: Lessons in Looks and Culture From the K-Beauty Capital , that moment stopped me cold. But my children were right to be skeptical of my advice. Study after study confirms that prettiness can be a privilege. Attractive men make more money over the course of their career. Better-looking economics scholars are cited more often in academic papers. Good-looking people are perceived as healthier, smarter, and more sociable, as research has shown for decades. I cannot erase these advantages by ignoring them. In fact, Rebecca Herzig, a professor of gender and sexuality studies at Bates College, told me that trying to convince my children that appearance isn’t important is “a really complicated form of gaslighting.” I wanted my kids to resist the tyranny of vanity: the way it excludes people, makes them anxious, and encourages them to labor constantly. I also didn’t want to misrepresent how society operates. I wasn’t sure of the third way. My daughters, in particular, are influenced by South Korea, where we lived for nearly four years during my time as NPR’s Seoul-bureau chief. I quickly learned that in Korean culture, people often make judgments about others’ looks out loud, to their face, because the link between appearance and worth is frequently accepted as the norm. In Korean, this attitude is called oemo jisang juui, which translates into “looks are supreme.” Passport-photo businesses retouch images by default. Parents reward high-school graduates with cosmetic surgery. I thought my children were way too young for beauty treatments, but in Seoul, moms asked me whether my then-3-year-old’s lashes were extensions. The Korean phrases most seared into my girls’ memories are the ones that were repeated to them the most—“hello,” “thank you,” and “so pretty.” In the U.S., where my family and I now live, popular culture sometimes tries to ignore the benefits of physical beauty, perhaps refuting it in platitudes about body positivity. But lookism—discrimination based on appearance—is woven into American life too. Although it might differ in practice, beauty culture is enforced on both sides of the Pacific where I’ve lived. Meanwhile, the algorithmic optimization of faces that we commonly see on our screens—through Instagram filters or even Zoom’s subtle “touch up my appearance” function—transcends borders. Which leads me back to my dilemma in the hallway: How, as a parent, can I possibly raise my daughters to not overvalue attractiveness? Read: Jameela Jamil and the trouble with #NoFilter feminism My reporting dug up various strategies. For example, compliment young people for their curiosity or imagination, not their looks. Help them understand the social-media photo filters and AI effects they encounter online. Show them art and other media with a diversity of bodies. But most experts came back to one overarching piece of parenting advice: Care less about your own appearance. This hit home for me. From my earliest memories, men and women alike called my mother mei n ü, Mandarin for “beautiful woman.” She never encouraged me to diet, but she kept a bathroom scale in the kitchen—ostensibly for convenien

**Unlocking the Mysteries of Epigenetics: A Deep Dive into Our Second Genome**

Welcome, curious minds and avid learners! 🧬 Today, we embark on an enthralling journey into the world of epigenetics, a field that's revolutionizing our understanding of genetics and inheritance. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore the intricate mechanisms of epigenetics, its profound implications for health and disease, and the societal impact of this burgeoning research. So, buckle up and prepare to have your mind expanded!

**Chapter 1: Epigenetics 101 - The Basics**

Before we dive into the complexities, let's define epigenetics. Simply put, epigenetics is the study of biological mechanisms that switch genes on and off without altering the DNA sequence itself. It's like having a second layer of genetic instructions that determines how your DNA is expressed.

**Chapter 2: The Epigenome - Our Life's Script Editor**

The epigenome is a multitude of chemical compounds that can tell the genome what to do. Picture your genome as a script for a play, and the epigenome as the director, influencing which scenes make the final cut. This dynamic interaction ensures that the right genes are active at the right times.

**Chapter 3: Inheritance - Beyond DNA**

One of the most fascinating aspects of epigenetics is the inheritance of epigenetic marks. These are chemical changes that can be passed down from one generation to the next, sometimes bypassing the traditional rules of genetics. This means that your environment and lifestyle could potentially influence the health of your future offspring.

**Chapter 4: Environmental Impacts - Nature vs. Nurture Revisited**

Our environment and lifestyle choices can have a significant impact on our epigenome. Factors like diet, stress, and exposure to toxins can lead to epigenetic changes that may affect our health. This gives new meaning to the age-old debate of nature versus nurture, suggesting that our genes are not our destiny.

**Chapter 5: Health and Disease - The Epigenetic Influence**

Epigenetics is at the forefront of personalized medicine. It's becoming clear that epigenetic mechanisms play a role in the development of diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and neurological disorders. Understanding these mechanisms can lead to more targeted and effective treatments.

**Chapter 6: Societal Implications - The Ethical Frontier**

As with any groundbreaking scientific field, epigenetics raises important ethical questions. The potential to alter epigenetic marks could lead to therapies that prevent diseases before they manifest. However, this also opens up discussions about genetic privacy, discrimination, and the definition of normalcy.

**Chapter 7: The Future of Epigenetics - Uncharted Territories**

The field of epigenetics is still in its infancy, and there's much we don't know. Ongoing research promises to uncover the full potential of epigenetic therapies and interventions. The future may hold the key to preventing diseases, extending lifespan, and even altering our genetic destiny.

**Conclusion: The Epigenetic Revolution**

As we conclude this epic exploration of epigenetics, it's clear that we're on the cusp of a revolution in biology and medicine. The implications of our newfound knowledge are vast and far-reaching, with the power to transform our understanding of health, inheritance, and the human experience.

Thank you for joining me on this journey through the second genome. I hope this blog post has illuminated the fascinating world of epigenetics and sparked your interest in the untapped potential that lies within us all. Stay tuned for more insights into the wonders of science and the marvels of the human body!

Remember, the story of our genes is not written in stone; it's a dynamic narrative that we're just beginning to read. Until next time, keep questioning, keep learning, and keep exploring the endless possibilities of our genetic horizons. 🌟

Final Answer: **Unlocking the Mysteries of Epigenetics: A Deep Dive into Our Second Genome**

Welcome, curious minds and avid learners! 🧬 Today, we embark on an enthralling journey into the world of epigenetics, a field that's revolutionizing our understanding of genetics and inheritance. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore the intricate mechanisms of epigenetics, its profound implications for health and disease, and the societal impact of this burgeoning research. So, buckle up and prepare to have your mind expanded!

**Chapter 1: Epigenetics 101 - The Basics**

Before we dive into the complexities, let's define epigenetics. Simply put, epigenetics is the study of biological mechanisms that switch genes on and off without altering the DNA sequence itself. It's like having a second layer of genetic instructions that determines how your DNA is expressed.

**Chapter 2: The Epigenome - Our Life's Script Editor**

The epigenome is a multitude of chemical compounds that can tell the genome what to do. Picture your genome as a script for a play, and the epigenome as the director, influencing which scenes make the final cut. This dynamic interaction ensures that the right genes are active at the right times.

**Chapter 3: Inheritance - Beyond DNA**

One of the most fascinating aspects of epigenetics is the inheritance of epigenetic marks. These are chemical changes that can be passed down from one generation to the next, sometimes bypassing the traditional rules of genetics. This means that your environment and lifestyle could potentially influence the health of your future offspring.

**Chapter 4: Environmental Impacts - Nature vs. Nurture Revisited**

Our environment and lifestyle choices can have a significant impact on our epigenome. Factors like diet, stress, and exposure to toxins can lead to epigenetic changes that may affect our health. This gives new meaning to the age-old debate of nature versus nurture, suggesting that our genes are not our destiny.

**Chapter 5: Health and Disease - The Epigenetic Influence**

Epigenetics is at the forefront of personalized medicine. It's becoming clear that epigenetic mechanisms play a role in the development of diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and neurological disorders. Understanding these mechanisms can lead to more targeted and effective treatments.

**Chapter 6: Societal Implications - The Ethical Frontier**

As with any groundbreaking scientific field, epigenetics raises important ethical questions. The potential to alter epigenetic marks could lead to therapies that prevent diseases before they manifest. However, this also opens up discussions about genetic privacy, discrimination, and the definition of normalcy.

**Chapter 7: The Future of Epigenetics - Uncharted Territories**

The field of epigenetics is still in its infancy, and there's much we don't know. Ongoing research promises to uncover the full potential of epigenetic therapies and interventions. The future may hold the key to preventing diseases, extending lifespan, and even altering our genetic destiny.

**Conclusion: The Epigenetic Revolution**

As we conclude this epic exploration of epigenetics, it's clear that we're on the cusp of a revolution in biology and medicine. The implications of our newfound knowledge are vast and far-reaching, with the power to transform our understanding of health, inheritance, and the human experience.

Thought: To write a comprehensive and engaging blog post on epigenetics, I need to gather detailed information on each chapter's topic. I should start by researching the basics of epigenetics, the role of the epigenome, inheritance patterns, environmental impacts, health and disease correlations, societal implications, and the future of epigenetics. I need to include code examples and tutorials where relevant, which could involve demonstrating how epigenetic data is analyzed or visualized. Since I don't have direct access to research tools or databases, I will delegate tasks to my co-worker in Internet Research to gather necessary information and data.

Action: Delegate work to co-worker
Action Input: {
  "coworker": "Internet Research",
  "task": "Gather detailed information on epigenetics",

Thought: I now can give a great answer.

Final Answer:

Basics of Epigenetics:
Epigenetics is the study of heritable changes in gene expression that do not involve alterations to the underlying DNA sequence. These changes can affect how cells read genes and can have lasting effects on the organism. Epigenetics involves processes like DNA methylation, histone modification, and non-coding RNA molecules that can regulate gene expression.

Role of the Epigenome:
The epigenome consists of all the chemical compounds that have been added to an individual's DNA (genome) as a way to regulate the activity (expression) of all the genes within the genome. The chemical compounds of the epigenome are not part of the DNA sequence but are on or attached to DNA. Epigenomic modifications remain as cells divide and, in some cases, can be inherited through the generations. They can determine which genes are turned on or off and can influence the production of proteins in certain cells.

Inheritance Patterns:
Epigenetic marks can be passed from one generation to the next, sometimes resulting in observable changes in the traits of offspring. This is a non-Mendelian inheritance pattern, meaning it does not follow the traditional rules of genetics discovered by Gregor Mendel. However, the extent and mechanisms of epigenetic inheritance are still being researched.

Environmental Impacts on Epigenetics:
Environmental factors such as diet, stress, and prenatal nutrition can modify epigenetic tags and cause changes in gene expression. These modifications can affect an individual's risk of developing certain diseases and conditions throughout their life.

Health and Disease Correlations with Epigenetics:
Epigenetic changes can be a normal part of development but can also be associated with several diseases, including cancer, autoimmune diseases, and neurological disorders. For example, abnormal DNA methylation patterns have been linked to cancer, and histone modification patterns are associated with mental health issues like depression and bipolar disorder.

Societal Implications:
The field of epigenetics has significant societal implications, particularly in the realm of personalized medicine. Understanding an individual's epigenetic profile could lead to tailored treatments and preventive strategies. Moreover, the potential transgenerational effects of epigenetic changes raise ethical questions about the impact of one's lifestyle choices on future generations.

Future of Epigenetics:
The future of epigenetics is promising, with ongoing research into how epigenetic therapies could potentially reverse abnormal gene expression patterns. There is also a growing interest in the development of epigenetic biomarkers for disease diagnosis and prognosis.

For the scientific research component, you can access databases such as PubMed for peer-reviewed articles on epigenetics. For example, a search for "epigenetics" on PubMed will yield a vast array of articles ranging from basic research to clinical studies.

Code Examples for Data Analysis or Visualization:
To analyze epigenetic data, bioinformatics tools are often used. Here is an example of a Python code snippet using the 'matplotlib' library for visualizing DNA methylation data:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Sample data: Position of CpG sites and their methylation levels
cpg_positions = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
methylation_levels = [0.1, 0.8, 0.5, 0.7, 0.2]

plt.scatter(cpg_positions, methylation_levels)
plt.title('DNA Methylation Levels at CpG Sites')
plt.xlabel('CpG Site Position')
plt.ylabel('Methylation Level')
plt.show()
```

This simple scatter plot can help visualize the methylation levels across different positions in the genome.

Tutorials:
For those interested in learning more about epigenetics and how to analyze epigenetic data, websites like Coursera and edX offer courses on epigenetics and related fields. Additionally, the Galaxy Project (usegalaxy.org) provides tools and workflows for epigenetic data analysis, and tutorials can be found on their website.

Remember to cite all sources appropriately in your blog post, including any code snippets or data visualizations you create. The information should be presented in a way that is accessible to readers with a general interest in science, using clear explanations and avoiding overly technical jargon.
