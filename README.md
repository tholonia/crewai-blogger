CrewAI is undebugable :(  I have not seen just obtusity since my Assembly Language days, or maybe beta Java.  Nevertheless, it (so far) seems worth slogging through... but my patience is wearing thin.  Maybe I am just getting to old to put up with meaningless, obtuse, and undecipherable error messages, or may because it's 2024!

With that off my chest, this is an attempt to get crewai working



## Status:

- blogger_v0.py
  - this is the most stripped down versions
  - 289 sec runtime on Ollama:mistral
  - Serper: causes crashes
  - DDGS: outputs nothing
  - Exa: 

- blogger_v1.py
  - Massively updated, but should run exactly the same







rure nightmare, AKIAC




This work is based on...

## CrewAI Blog examples
